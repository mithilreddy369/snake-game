# Snake Game

This is a Snake Game implemented using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a modern, futuristic design with dynamic stats, including **High Score**, **Games Played**, and **Current Score**. It also uses **localStorage** to persist high scores and the number of games played across sessions.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts its layout based on screen size for an optimal experience on different devices.
- **Persistent Stats**: Tracks and displays high score and games played even after a page reload.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes a start button to reset the game and show score updates.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the game interface and graphics.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, event handling, and score tracking.
- **CSS3**: For modern styling and responsive design.

## Game Logic
The game includes the following key features:
- **Snake Movements**: The snake moves across the canvas, responding to keyboard inputs (Arrow keys or WASD).
- **Food Generation**: Randomly generates food items for the snake to eat, which increases the snake's size.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions with walls and the snake's body, ending the game when a collision occurs.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score, high score, and the number of games played, which are updated throughout the game.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys or **WASD** keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the food to grow the snake and increase the score.
- Avoid colliding with walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.
- The game ends when a collision occurs, and you can restart it by pressing the **Start** button.
